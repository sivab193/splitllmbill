# SplitLLMBill: Revolutionizing Shared Expense Management

The genesis of SplitLLMBill lies in the shared frustrations of a close-knit group of friends. Our evenings spent together were always memorable, filled with laughter and camaraderie. However, the joyous moments often gave way to a tedious task once we parted ways: splitting the bills. Countless hours were wasted compiling receipts and tallying expenses, dampening the spirits of our gatherings. Determined to find a solution, we embarked on a journey to create a tool that would alleviate the burden of bill splitting and expense tracking.

## Simplifying Financial Management

SplitLLMBill revolutionizes the way friends manage their shared expenses. Upon signing up, users gain access to a platform that simplifies financial management like never before. Adding friends is a breeze, thanks to unique codes that facilitate seamless connections.  Events can be created effortlessly, and expenses can be shared directly between friends or in events. However, the real magic lies in the ability to scan bills, a feature that sets SplitLLMBill apart. With just a few taps, users can capture receipts and let the system do the rest, providing a clear breakdown of who owes what. But SplitLLMBill is more than just a bill-splitting tool; it's a comprehensive expense management platform. Users can track their personal expenses through a user-friendly chatbot interface and access detailed summaries and visual graphs to gain insights into their spending habits.

## Robust Technologies and Agile Methodologies

The foundation of SplitLLMBill is built on robust technologies and agile methodologies. Python powers the backend, with a sophisticated system of APIs and connections to Gemini for bill processing. MongoDB serves as our data storage solution, ensuring scalability and reliability. On the frontend, React brings our vision to life, delivering a seamless user experience. Deployment on Google Cloud Platform ensures lightning-fast response times, while Vercel handles frontend deployment with efficiency. Our development process was guided by agile sprints, allowing us to iterate rapidly and incorporate feedback effectively.

## Overcoming Challenges

Building SplitLLMBill was not without its challenges. Integrating the scan bill feature posed significant technical hurdles, requiring meticulous attention to detail and innovative problem-solving. Ensuring the security of user data was another paramount concern, prompting us to implement stringent authentication and authorization mechanisms. Balancing frontend and backend development to deliver a cohesive user experience proved to be a delicate balancing act, requiring careful coordination and collaboration.
